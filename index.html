        <p><span class="first">Ruby</span> is a dynamic, open source programming language focused on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write. The Ruby programming language is best known as a language for building <span class="important">web applications</span> in its corresponding Ruby on Rails framework. Taking the Ruby course is particularly beneficial due to the general-purpose nature of Ruby makes it suitable for a wide array of programming tasks; much like Pearl, Python, and other languages. </p>
